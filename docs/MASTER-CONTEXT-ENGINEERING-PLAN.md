2. **🚨 ZERO TEST COVERAGE**: Entire codebase lacks tests (0% coverage)
3. **⚠️ iOS VERSION CONFLICT**: Docs state iOS 17.0, code targets iOS 16.0
4. **⚠️ BUNDLE ID MISMATCH**: com.anthropic.ClaudeCode vs com.claudecode.ios
5. **⚠️ SSH DEPENDENCY REMOVED**: Documentation still references removed Shout library
