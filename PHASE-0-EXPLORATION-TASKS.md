## 📊 Spike Decision Matrix

| Spike | Risk Level | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|-------|------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Backend Models | 🔴 High | Critical | 4h | P0 |
| Bundle ID | 🔴 High | Blocking | 2h | P0 |
| Test Infrastructure | 🔴 High | Critical | 6h | P0 |
| SSE/WebSocket | 🟡 Medium | Important | 4h | P1 |
| MCP Integration | 🟢 Low | Enhancement | 3h | P2 |

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Day 1 Completion Targets:
