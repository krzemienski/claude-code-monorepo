## Network & SSE Validation

### Backend Connectivity
```json
Request: GET http://localhost:8000/health
Response: 200 OK
Body: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-08-30T09:05:21Z"}
```

### SSE Streaming
- **Connection**: Established successfully
- **Event Handling**: SSEClient properly initialized
- **Reconnection**: Auto-retry logic implemented
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback on connection failure

## Critical Issues

### High Priority
1. ~~**JSON Decoding Error**: Health check response expects "ok" field but receives "status"~~
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED
   - **Resolution**: Updated HealthResponse model to use `status: String` with computed `ok` property for backward compatibility
   - **Verification**: Console monitoring confirms successful health checks every 2 seconds with 200 OK responses

### Medium Priority
1. ~~**SSH Functionality Removed**: MonitoringView shows SSH features disabled~~
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED
   - **Resolution**: Removed SSH UI elements and replaced with improved simulation controls
   - **Impact**: Cleaner, more appropriate UI for iOS app

2. **UIKit Visual Style Warnings**: Missing visual style classes registration
   - **Status**: ⚠️ Identified as iOS 18 Simulator-Specific
   - **Impact**: Minor console warnings, no user impact on functionality
   - **Note**: Does not affect app operation, common in iOS 18 simulators

### Low Priority
1. **Accessibility Improvements**: Some views lack proper labels
2. **iPad Keyboard Shortcuts**: Not fully implemented
3. **Landscape Optimization**: Some views could better utilize space
