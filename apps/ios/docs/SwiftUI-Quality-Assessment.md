# SwiftUI Quality Assessment Report

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive quality assessment of the Claude Code iOS app's SwiftUI implementation, evaluating component architecture, state management, accessibility compliance, and design system adherence.

## SwiftUI Quality Assessment

### Component Architecture: 8/10
**Strengths:**
- Well-structured view hierarchy with clear separation of concerns

- Missing protocol-based component abstractions

### State Management: 7/10
**Strengths:**
- Proper use of @StateObject for view models

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach
```swift
// Example ViewModel Test Structure
class AnalyticsViewModelTests: XCTestCase {
    func testLoadStats() async {
        // Given
        let mockClient = MockAPIClient()
        let viewModel = AnalyticsViewModel(client: mockClient)
        
        // When
        await viewModel.loadStats()
        
        // Then
        XCTAssertNotNil(viewModel.stats)
        XCTAssertEqual(viewModel.timeSeriesData.count, 24)
    }
}
```

### Accessibility Testing
```swift
// Example Accessibility Test
func testVoiceOverNavigation() {
    let app = XCUIApplication()
    app.launchArguments = ["--uitesting", "--voiceover"]
    
    // Test VoiceOver can navigate all elements
    XCTAssertTrue(app.buttons["Analytics"].isAccessibilityElement)
    XCTAssertEqual(app.buttons["Analytics"].accessibilityLabel, "Analytics Dashboard")
}
```

### Snapshot Testing
```swift
// Example Snapshot Test
func testAnalyticsViewSnapshot() {
    let view = AnalyticsView()
        .environmentObject(MockSettings())
    
    assertSnapshot(matching: view, as: .image(on: .iPhone13Pro))
}
```

## Conclusion
