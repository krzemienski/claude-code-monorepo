- Neon cyan (#00FFE1) on dark background: 14.5:1 ✅
- All text meets or exceeds 4.5:1 ratio
- Large text meets or exceeds 3:1 ratio

### 4.2 Touch Targets
✅ **Minimum Sizes**
- All interactive elements ≥ 44x44 points
- Proper spacing between touch targets
- Enhanced hit areas for small icons
- Keyboard focus indicators visible

### 4.3 Focus Management
